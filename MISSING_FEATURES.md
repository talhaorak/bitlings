- Implement Core AI (`BM-Stress` Basics):
    - Connect Bitling needs directly to `Stress` generation.
    - Implement basic BM-like network settling.
    - Link network states to action probabilities.
    - Implement basic Hebbian learning based on `Stress` reduction.
- Implement Compartments: Structure the AI into the defined compartments.
- Refine Hard-coded Behaviors: Improve obstacle avoidance, pathfinding to food/sleep spots.
- Implement Temporal Learning: Add eligibility traces for time-delayed associations (especially for text input).
- Implement Text Input: Allow user text input; handle unknown words by growing the network dynamically.
- Replace Placeholders: Integrate proper 2D sprite assets and animations.
- World Persistence: Save and load simulation state.
- UI Enhancements: More detailed status displays, interaction options.
- Scalability & Optimization: Address performance bottlenecks as the simulation grows.
- Dynamic Topology: Fully implement network pruning and growth rules.
